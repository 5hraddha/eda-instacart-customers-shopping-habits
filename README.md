# Exploratory Data Analysis - Shopping habits of Instacart Customers

Instacart is a grocery delivery platform where customers can place a grocery order and have it delivered to them, similar to how Uber Eats and Door Dash work. This particular dataset was [publicly released](https://tech.instacart.com/3-million-instacart-orders-open-sourced-d40d29ead6f2) by Instacart in 2017 for a [Kaggle competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/instacart-market-basket-analysis/overview).
